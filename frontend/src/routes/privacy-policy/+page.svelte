	<h1>privacy policy</h1>

	<h2>introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Paaster.io is an open source end-to-end encrypted paste bin that values and respects the privacy
		of its users. This privacy policy outlines the types of data we collect, how we use and protect
		that data, and your rights regarding your personal information.
	</p>

	<h2>data collection</h2>
	<p>When you use paaster.io, we may collect certain information from you, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Any text you paste into the paste bin.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We do not collect any personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide it to us.
		For example, if you contact us with a question or issue, we will collect your email address so
		we can respond to you.
	</p>

	<p>
		Additionally, it is important to note that any pastes that you store on Paaster.io are not
		accessible by us. We provide end-to-end encryption, which means that only you and anyone you
		choose to share the paste with can read the information you have pasted.
	</p>

	<h2>data use</h2>
	<p>We use the data we collect in order to provide you with the paaster.io service.</p>

		We do not share any of the information we collect with third parties, except in the following
		circumstances:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If we are required to do so by law.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>data protection</h2>
	<p>
		We take the security of your data very seriously. In addition to the end-to-end encryption we
		provide, we take steps to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access,
		disclosure, or destruction. We use industry-standard security measures, including encryption,
		firewalls, and secure servers, to protect your data.
	</p>

	<h2>your rights</h2>
	<p>
		You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information that we collect. You
		can also request that we stop using your personal information for certain purposes. If you would
		like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:wardpearce@pm.me"

	<h2>changes to this privacy policy</h2>
	<p>
		We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for
		other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting
		the updated policy on our website.
